## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m a web developer and M.S. student in Cybersecurity (Computer Science track) at The George Washington University.
My background comes from hands-on client work where I built, maintained, and improved production web applications. Over time, I learned how to manage multiple projects, debug issues under pressure, and communicate clearly with both clients and teammates.
Alongside software development, I’m building a strong foundation in secure-by-design systems, authentication concepts, and common web risks.
I’m currently open to internships, entry-level roles, and part-time opportunities.
